# Changelog 1.3

Resolves GAP-024 to GAP-028 and removes inline values from the dashboard, print detail and asset list. Version 1.2.1 follows below.

| Gap | Result |
|---|---|
| GAP-024 Dimmed deleted and archived thumbnails, row flash, muted row text | resolved: `.is-deleted` (45%), `.is-archived` (60%), `.pp-row.flash` and `.pp-row .muted` in `bundle.css`; no inline opacity |
| GAP-025 Phone customer chip row | resolved: `.pp-chips` and `.pp-chip` with `aria-pressed`, component CustomerChips |
| GAP-026 Delete a whole klant | resolved: ghost icon button on CustomerCard, "Klant verwijderen" in the filtered phone view, destructive ConfirmDialog, deleted card with Herstellen; keys `customers.delete`, `confirm.deleteCustomer`, `confirm.deleteCustomerBody` |
| GAP-027 Tag editor and tag management | resolved: TagEditor popover (`.pp-tagpop`), palette `.pp-pal`, new page ScreenTags (Admin and Editor); keys `tags.*`, `confirm.deleteTag*`, `error.tagExists`, `error.tagTooLong` |
| GAP-028 Copy for fullscreen and print count | resolved: `viewer.fullscreen`, `viewer.exitFullscreen`, `customers.printCount` (ICU plural) |

## New and changed
- **Tokens (new, 10):** `tag-rose`, `tag-orange`, `tag-amber`, `tag-lime`, `tag-teal`, `tag-sky`, `tag-blue`, `tag-violet`, `tag-lilac`, `tag-grey`, per theme. Chip text `#141a33` or `#ffffff`; all new pairs pass WCAG 2.2 AA (121 pairs, 0 failures).
- **Classes (new):** `.pp-chips`, `.pp-chip`, `.pp-cust`, `.pp-custs`, `.pp-toolbar`, `.pp-tagpop`, `.pp-pal`, `.pp-tagrow`, `.pp-plate`, `.pp-detail`, `.pp-showcase`, `.pp-card-hd`, `.pp-viewer .full`, `.pp-viewer.fluid`, `[data-c=…]`, text, gap and layout utilities. **Changed:** thumbnails, cards and rows (`.is-deleted`, `.is-archived`, `.flash`).
- **Components (new):** CustomerCard, CustomerChips, TagEditor. **Changed:** PrintCard, PrintRow, AssetListItem (40px plate thumbnail), TagChip (`data-c`), Viewer3D (fullscreen), ConfirmDialog (klant, tag), AppShell (Tags nav item for Admin and Editor).
- **Screens (new):** ScreenTags, desktop and phone. **Changed:** ScreenDashboard, ScreenPrintDetail, User role view.
- **Audit:** inline values in the dashboard, print detail and asset list previews moved to classes. Remaining inline: `--c1`, `--tag`, `--tag-ink` (data) and `min-height` on preview devices (scaffolding, not for the app).

## Breaking changes
- Tag colours are now palette keys; an old free hex still renders through `--tag` and `--tag-ink` but is no longer offered in the editor.
- Print-detail delete and "Toon verwijderde" are role-gated as described in the README.
- The app can remove its temporary `ds-gap` styles for GAP-024 to GAP-028.

# Changelog 1.2.1

Patch release: resolves GAP-023. Version 1.2 follows below.

| Gap | Result |
|---|---|
| GAP-023 No class to swap a table for cards at 480px and below; login page padding stays 24px on phones | resolved: wrapper classes `pp-only-wide` and `pp-only-phone`, and `pp-center` pads the page with `space-4` (16px) at 480px and below |

- **How to use it:** put both layouts in the DOM, each in its own wrapper without a display of its own: `<div class="pp-only-wide">table</div>` and `<div class="pp-only-phone">cards</div>`. Above 480px only the first shows; at 480px and below only the second. The wide table keeps its own `pp-scroll` box as a fallback. The preview container `pp-device.phone` forces the same rules at a fixed width.
- **Screens changed:** Gebruikers and Toegang (table and cards in one DOM), Login (phone padding from the class instead of an inline value).
- **Tokens:** none new or changed. **Breaking changes:** none; the temporary `ds-gap: GAP-023` stylesheet in the app can be removed.
- **Not changed:** other tables (Facturen, Openstaand, print lists) keep their current phone behaviour; the swap classes are available for them.

# Changelog 1.2

Version 1.2 resolves GAP-013 to GAP-022 from the implementation of 1.1. Version 1.1 is kept below for history.

## Gap resolution

| Gap | Result |
|---|---|
| GAP-013 Deel-link for niet-factureren klanten | resolved: the disabled create dialog is gone; the Klant field shows the help "Deze klant wordt niet gefactureerd. De link toont alleen de printlijst, zonder bedragen." and Maken stays enabled; ScreenSharePage gets a not-billed variant (Print, Project, Datum only, intro "Hier zie je de prints die voor je gemaakt zijn.", no amounts, payment badges, totals or PDF button). DocOverview is unchanged: a niet-factureren klant has no Overzicht PDF |
| GAP-014 "Nooit" as expiry | resolved: fourth option Nooit with the help "De link blijft werken tot je hem intrekt."; ShareLinkRow shows "Verloopt niet" in `muted` (class `never`); the share page omits the expiry notice |
| GAP-015 AppShell has no responsive CSS | resolved: media queries at 900px (56px icon rail with tooltips) and 480px (top bar, bottom bar, `.pp-drawer`); phone rules exist as media queries, so the app never sets `.phone`; one DOM for every size; rail and drawer are drawn in the AppShell page |
| GAP-016 No line-height tokens or base typography | resolved: 8 `leading-*` tokens and a `body` rule in `bundle.css`; all raw line-heights in `bundle.css` now use the tokens |
| GAP-017 Raw sizes in login and system states | resolved: classes `pp-auth`, `pp-auth .or`, `pp-state`, `pp-state.wide`, `pp-iwrap.compact`, `pp-dialog.sm`; the 22px state heading is merged into `text-xl` / `leading-xl` (20/28), so no 22px token was added |
| GAP-018 Local sign-in by name or e-mail | resolved as proposed: field "E-mailadres of naam" (`type="text"`, `autocomplete="username"`), key `auth.identifier` |
| GAP-019 Choosing a password after a temporary one | resolved: new login-card state "Nieuw wachtwoord kiezen" (with errors) and a small dialog "Wachtwoord resetten voor '{naam}'" where the admin types the temporary password |
| GAP-020 "Rol wijzigen" on phones | resolved: the same native Select inside the card; the button and its copy are dropped |
| GAP-021 Editor rows in the access matrix | resolved: Editor rows look like Admin rows (disabled, checked, "· Editor"); note "Admin en Editor hebben altijd toegang."; phone cards show a disabled, checked list |
| GAP-022 Error copy for sign-in and users | resolved: `auth.oidcFailed`, `error.passwordTooShort`, `error.userExists`, `confirm.deleteUserBody`, all drawn in their screens |

## New tokens

`leading-xs` 16px, `leading-sm` 20px, `leading-base` 22px, `leading-md` 24px, `leading-lg` 26px, `leading-xl` 28px, `leading-2xl` 32px, `leading-3xl` 40px. They sit in the `fontSize` family of `tokens.json` (the format has no separate line-height family) and appear in `tokens.css` as `--leading-*`. No colour token is new or changed; the contrast report has 6 more rows (107 pairs, all pass).

## Changed tokens

None.

## New classes in `components/bundle.css`

`body` base rule, `pp-drawer-backdrop`, `pp-drawer`, `pp-auth` (with `.or`), `pp-state` (and `.wide`), `pp-iwrap.compact`, `pp-dialog.sm`, `pp-sr` (visually hidden), `pp-main > h1`, `pp-share .never`, plus the responsive rules for `pp-app`, `pp-side`, `pp-nav`, `pp-phone-top`, `pp-bottomnav`. The preview containers `pp-device.rail` and `pp-device.phone` force the same rules at a fixed width.

## New or changed components

- **AppShell:** responsive spec, DOM contract, icon rail, drawer.
- **ShareLinkRow:** "Verloopt niet" state.
- **AccessMatrix:** Editor rows, new note.
- **ConfirmDialog:** `pp-dialog sm`, delete-user confirmation with its consequence sentence.

## New or changed screens

- **ScreenLogin:** identifier field, Authentik-failed, session-ended and new-password states.
- **ScreenUsers:** compact role select, native select on phones, reset-password dialog, create-dialog errors, delete icon button.
- **ScreenShareLinks:** Nooit and not-billed creation, a link without expiry in the list.
- **ScreenSharePage:** not-billed variant, no expiry notice.
- **ScreenAccess:** Editor rows.
- **ScreenSystemStates:** classes instead of inline sizes (title 20px instead of 22px).
- **ScreenSettings:** README text about the Deel-link for niet-factureren klanten.

## Decisions applied

- **Credited prints:** a credited print becomes Afgeschreven. This is stated in the README rules; no new component was needed because the status already exists.
- **Sign-in rules:** Authentik admin group becomes Admin, a 60-minute idle and 12-hour session limit, 5 login attempts per minute, passwords of at least 12 characters and the last-Admin guard are recorded in README and the screen specs.

## Additions beyond the gaps

- An `info` notice "Je sessie is verlopen. Log opnieuw in." on the login card.
- A ghost button "Uitloggen" on the new-password card, so the user is never stuck.
- The user Denise added to the sample data (a second User row).

## Breaking changes

- **Markup:** AppShell. Nav links need `<span class="lbl">` and `data-tip`, the brand needs `.ini` and `.full`, and on phones `header.pp-phone-top`, `nav.pp-bottomnav` and the drawer sit inside `.pp-app` instead of next to it. `.pp-phone-main` and the `.phone .pp-stats` rule still exist for compatibility but are no longer used.
- **Copy keys removed:** `share.noShareLink`, `share.notBilled`, `access.adminAlways` (use `access.allAccessRoles`), `auth.email` (use `auth.identifier`).
- **Copy key text changed:** `auth.wrong` is now "Verkeerd e-mailadres, naam of wachtwoord."
- **Visual:** state-page titles are 20px instead of 22px; dialogs with a maximum width of 400px or less now use the 380px `pp-dialog sm`, wider ones the 440px default.

## Known limits

- Many previews still contain inline `style` attributes for demo layout. They are not part of the contract; the app uses only tokens and the classes above. The inline values in login, state pages, role select and ConfirmDialog (GAP-017) are gone; a full audit of every preview is not done.
- Wide layouts (1440px and up) are specified in the README text, not drawn.

# Changelog 1.1

Version 1.1 resolves every open gap from the implementation of 1.0.

## Gap resolution

| Gap | Result |
|---|---|
| GAP-001 No screens, screen copy or invoice layout | resolved: 17 screen and document pages added (below), screen copy in each README and in `copy-deck.md` |
| GAP-002, GAP-003 | not in the list received; nothing done |
| GAP-004 No "partially paid" status | resolved: badge Deels betaald, remaining-amount line, PaymentPanel, OutstandingGroup, PrintCard, PrintRow, share page, documents |
| GAP-005 Per-slot filament usage | resolved: slot rows and slicer-colour swatch in AssetListItem; CostBreakdown slot sub-rows; tint fallback rule in SpoolSwatch |
| GAP-006 Aantal keer geprint | resolved: compact input in AssetListItem, "× n" in meta, "n × …" in CostBreakdown |
| GAP-007 Duplicate file warning | resolved: badge Mogelijk dubbel plus visible hint line (see deviations) |
| GAP-008 3MF plates as rows | resolved: child rows "Plaat n" with their own controls and slots |
| GAP-009 Manual price per kg, grams and time | resolved: new CostOverrideDialog opened by "Aanpassen" |
| GAP-010 Niet factureren customers | resolved: badge, "Kosten" display, PaymentPanel note, Instellingen toggle; no Deel-link for such klanten (your decision) |
| GAP-011 Write-off states | resolved: written-off PaymentPanel state, admin undo, new WriteOffDialog with optional reason |
| GAP-012 Invoice register, finalise, credit notes | resolved: new Facturen screen, finalise dialog, credit-note dialog, "Op factuur" badge and locked state |

No gap was rejected or merged. Decisions you made while resolving: Facturen is visible to Admin and Editor and only Admins create a Creditnota; a Creditnota covers the whole invoice or chosen lines; a klant that is niet factureren cannot get a Deel-link.

## New tokens

None. Every new state uses existing tokens. Version in `tokens.json` is now 1.1.

## Changed tokens

None. Values, names and the `tokens.css` fallback are unchanged.

## New components

- **AppShell** (Screens group): sidebar, icon rail, top bar, bottom bar and drawer.
- **CostOverrideDialog**: manual price per kg, weight and print time.
- **WriteOffDialog**: partial write-off with optional reason.

## Changed components

- **StatusBadge:** added Deels betaald, Niet factureren, Mogelijk dubbel, Op factuur {nummer}, Concept, Definitief, Creditnota; added the `pp-remaining` line.
- **MoneyDisplay:** remaining-amount and negative variants, "Kosten" label.
- **SpoolSwatch:** `.slicer` variant with the "slicer" hint chip; thumbnail tint rule.
- **AssetListItem:** times-printed input, slot rows, plate child rows, duplicate hint, automatic and manual exclusion with reason; layout now adapts to container width.
- **CostBreakdown:** header with Aanpassen, per-slot sub-rows, times-printed calculation text, "Niet meegeteld" line.
- **PaymentPanel:** states for partial, written off, niet factureren, rol User, locked by invoice, missing cost; admin-only undo actions.
- **OutstandingGroup:** partial line variant; totals are sums of remainders.
- **PrintCard, PrintRow:** partial, niet factureren, deleted (with Herstellen) variants.
- **ConfirmDialog:** finalise variant and the new undo and finalise copy.

## New screens and documents (group Screens)

ScreenLogin, AppShell, ScreenDashboard, ScreenPrintDetail, ScreenInvoiceExport, ScreenOutstanding, ScreenShareLinks, ScreenAccess, ScreenUsers, ScreenSettings, ScreenApiDocs, ScreenSharePage, ScreenInvoices (new page), ScreenSystemStates, DocInvoice (Factuur, Concept, Creditnota), DocReminder (Herinnering), DocOverview (Overzicht).

## Changed screens

None; there were no screens in 1.0.

## New files and copy

- `copy-deck.md`: about 150 new keys, grouped by area.
- `contrast.md`: 11 new rows (neutral badge text, remaining-amount line, duplicate hint, document text on white paper); all pass.
- `bundle.css`: classes `pp-slot`, `pp-hintchip`, `pp-qty`, `pp-reason`, `pp-remaining`, `pp-assetlist`, `pp-device`, `pp-app`, `pp-side`, `pp-nav`, `pp-main`, `pp-bottomnav`, `pp-paper` and layout helpers.
- README: roles, documents, screens, payment rules and the "no VAT" rule.

## Deviations from the proposals

- **GAP-007:** the explanation is a visible hint line instead of a tooltip, so it is readable on touch and by screen readers; the badge itself is as proposed.
- **GAP-009:** when Spoolman supplies the price per kg the price field is disabled with "Prijs komt uit Spoolman.", which follows the precedence you gave (Spoolman, then handmatig, then standaard per materiaal).
- **GAP-001:** screens are shown at desktop (980px) and phone (360px) widths, with both themes through the page's theme switch. Tablet and wide behaviour is specified in text under Responsive and AppShell, not drawn.
- **GAP-012:** concept PDFs are not stored, so the register lists only final invoices and credit notes.

## Breaking changes

- **Copy:** the vocabulary entry "BTW" is removed from the README; no token or component used it. Any implementation of a VAT toggle, rate, VAT number or KvK field from the brief must be removed.
- **Behaviour:** "Betaling ongedaan maken" is now Admin-only and always confirms.
- **Layout (AssetListItem):** `.pp-asset` is now a two-line grid by default and switches to one line inside a `.pp-assetlist` container that is 760px wide or more; `.pp-slot` is now a wrapping flex row. Consumers that copied the 1.0 three-column grid must wrap the list in `.pp-assetlist`.
- **Payment status:** a print with `0 < paid < price` now shows Deels betaald instead of Open, and counts only its remainder in Openstaand.
- **Invoice numbers:** only final invoices and credit notes are numbered; a Concept download and a Herinnering have no number.

## Notes

IBAN, address and e-mail on the documents are placeholders. The Swagger operations on the API-docs screen are illustrative.
